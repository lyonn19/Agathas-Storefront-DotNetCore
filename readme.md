Agatha's Clothing Store in .NET Core 
====================================================================================
On-going work in progress.  Agatha's Storefront is the sample application from the [Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns][1] book by [Scott Millett][2].  Code was a litle dated and I was a littled bored so I decided work on getting it to .NET Core 2.0 and use Web API instead of the separate controllers class.

Agatha's Storefront:
  -Demonstrates how to use some Gang of Four design patterns to improve your ASP.NET code.
  - Shows how Martin Fowler's enterprise patterns fit into an enterprise-level ASP.NET site.
  - Provides details on how to layer an ASP.NET application and separate your concerns and responsibilities.
  - Details AJAX patterns using JQuery and Json.
  - Shares best practice tools for ASP.NET such as AutoMapper, NHibernate, and StructureMap.
  - Uncovers tips for separating a site's UX and presentation layer from the pluggable data access layer and business logic layer.
